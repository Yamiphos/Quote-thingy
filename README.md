# Quote Project

A small JavaScript-based web app that displays random quotes, with filtering by author and topic. Built using plain JavaScript and HTML, and backed by a local JSON file served with Express.

First time doing a couple things, javascript for front end scripts, npm and Node.js for back end, Git for uploading and a bit of version control 

Made it because my friends keep quoting random things and i got the idea to make this.
